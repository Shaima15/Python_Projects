**Project descriptions**

**1- Diabetes Prediction**

This project used publicly available data to predict diabetic female patients based on relevant features such as blood glucose, pregnancy, etc. It involved EDA, data standardization, and using an instance of Support Vector Machine classifier to classify the data. 

**Results**: A predictive system that can take input values and predict whether the patient is diabetic or not with test data accuracy of 77%.

**2- Credit Card Fraud Prediction**

Initially, this project trained and validated various machine-learning models using an imbalanced dataset to predict fraudulent activities. However, to improve results, the dataset was balanced by reducing the number of the majority class. Then, all of the models were trained and validated on the balanced dataset to select the best model with an optimal recall and f1-score. 

The following models were trained: 

- Logistic Regression (best model)
- Neural Network (1 and 2 relu)
- Random forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier 
- Support Vector Machine

**Results**: Achieved a 91% recall with logistic regression (best model), a 34% improvement over the 57% recall of the random forest model, significantly enhancing fraud detection.

**3- HR Employee Dataset Descriptive Analytics**

This project utilized Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset with 14,999 observations. It conducted data preprocessing, visualization, and key findings summarization to uncover reasons for employee attrition, and handled outliers, leading to strategic retention recommendations.

**4- Financial Data Web Scraping**

This project utilized Google Colab to web scrap S&P 500 companies available in Wikipedia. It included data exploration, creating a new data frame for the Energy sector, and importing yfinance library to download historical stock price information from Yahoo Finance (2021-2024). Also, 'for loops' were used to create separate data frames for each ticker which were later appended into an empty data frame. Additionally, Plotly was used to create a candlestick visualization for the ticker APA. Finally, the data frame containing all the tickers was exported as a CSV file.
