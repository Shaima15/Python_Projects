**Project descriptions**

**1- Diabetes Prediction**

This project used publicly available data to predict diabetic female patients based on relevant features such as blood glucose, pregnancy, etc. It involved EDA, data standardization, and using an instance of Support Vector Machine classifier to classify the data. 

**Results**: A predictive system that can take input values and predict whether the patient is diabetic or not with test data accuracy of 77% 

**Skills**: · Python (Programming Language) · Scikit-Learn · Healthcare Analytics · Predictive Analytics



**2- Credit Card Fraud Prediction**

Initially, this project trained and validated various machine-learning models using an imbalanced dataset to predict fraudulent activities. However, to improve results, the dataset was balanced by reducing the number of the majority class. Then, all of the models were trained and validated on the balanced dataset to select the best model with an optimal recall and f1-score. 

The following models were trained: 

- Logistic Regression (best model)
- Neural Network (1 and 2 relu)
- Random forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier 
- Support Vector Machine

**Results**: Achieved a 91% recall with logistic regression (best model), a 34% improvement over the 57% recall of the random forest model, significantly enhancing fraud detection

**3- HR Employee Dataset Descriptive Analytics**

This project used Python to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset with 14999 observations and 11 variables to derive insights on why employees leave the organization. It included data preprocessing, data visualization, and a summary of key findings
