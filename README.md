**Project descriptions**

**1- Diabetes prediction using machine learning**

This project used publicly available data to predict diabetic female patients based on relevant features such as blood glucose, pregnancy, etc. It involved EDA, checking accuracy and using classification report. 

Models used: Decision trees and logistic regression 

Results: Since data was moderatly imbalanced, recall was used as the deciding factor. Logistic regression is better able to handle imbalanced data, so it had a recall of 77% compared to decision tree were the recall was 66%, making the former a better predictive model that ensures less missed diagnoses and improved model performance for clinical applications

**2- HR Employee Dataset Descriptive Analytics**

This project utilized Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset with 14,999 observations. It conducted data preprocessing, visualization, and key findings summarization to uncover reasons for employee attrition, and handled outliers, leading to strategic retention recommendations.
